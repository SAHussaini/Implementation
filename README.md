# Implementation
This repository contains two files: implementation.gps and . 

The implementation.gps is our implementation graph grammar in the dissertation; it can be downloaded and imported into GROOVE simulations. 

The  contains all the appendices from our dissertation, including rule documentation (together with diagrams) and a small tutorial explaining how to use the implementation grammar. Effectively, the  file replaces our README.
