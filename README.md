# Implementation
This repository contains two files: implementation.gps and 6CCS3PRJ_Final_Year_K1894230_Appendices.pdf. 

The implementation.gps is our implementation graph grammar in the dissertation; it can be downloaded and imported into GROOVE simulations. 

The 6CCS3PRJ_Final_Year_K1894230_Appendices.pdf contains all the appendices from our dissertation, including rule documentation (together with diagrams) and a small tutorial explaining how to use the implementation grammar. Effectively, the file replaces our README.
